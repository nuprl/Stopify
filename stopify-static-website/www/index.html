    <p>This is a demo of Stopify, a JavaScript-to-JavaScript compiler that
    makes it possible for other compilers and Web-based IDEs to gracefully
    run long-running programs, stop non-terminating programs, support
    blocking I/O, set breakpoints, and step through code <i>entirely
    in the browser</i>. To demonstrate, this demo applies Stopify to the
    JavaScript output by several existing compilers without making changes
    to the compilers themselves. We showcase programs that take several
    seconds to run or run forever. These programs would normally freeze your
    browser tab, but Stopify keeps this page responsive and let's you
    gracefully interrupt at any time. For certain languages, Stopify
    even supports setting breakpoints and single-stepping. The FAQ
    and Source Code provide more information and discuss how to use
    Stopify to enhance your compiler or IDE.
